        "description": "Bitcoin is not private by default, it is intentionally designed to be pseudonymous, and every transaction is public and stored forever. In order to regain some confidentiality, we must use best user practices and specific tools integrated into our software. From avoiding address reuse to CoinJoin, through mixing your coins and connecting to your own node, we will help you on your journey towards privacy."

      "description": "Privacy is a fundamental right. While we aspire to a world where privacy is the default, it is not the reality we live in. We will try to explain to you the best practices, assist you with tutorials, and set you on a more sovereign path regarding your data.",

        "description": "In the era of mass surveillance, regaining a certain level of privacy in your everyday life is essential. Given that each user will have a certain degree of paranoia and technological knowledge, it is perfectly normal to use certain tools and adapt them to your needs. Here, we will explore different protection solutions such as VPNs, Tor, Tails OS, PGP, encrypted messages, and much more."

      "description": "A Bitcoin wallet is like your keychain. It allows you to spend and receive bitcoin. There are a lot of different types of wallets, all with different use cases, functions, costs, and user experiences. Each bitcoiner will use a different device based on their needs, level of exigence, and experience.",
      "desktop": {
        "description": "Desktop wallets are usually for more advanced users as they combine the use of hardware devices and the desktop wallet software. It's like having a new, more custom, and functionality-intensive interface for your hardware device to use. Such wallets offer multi-signature options, privacy features, inheritance integration mechanisms, and more."

      "hardware": {
        "description": "Hardware wallets are usually used to store your long-term bitcoin savings. They are physical devices that aren't connected to the internet (often called \"cold wallets\") and are usually highly secure. Even though these devices are often open-source regarding their software, the hardware costs around 50 to 300 euros. Consider these devices like a bank account for larger amounts of savings that you would use once in a while."

      "mobile": {
        "description": "Mobile wallets are usually used for daily spending. They integrate the Lightning Network for low-fee, instant transactions. They are usually connected to the internet (often called \"hot wallets\") and are therefore less secure than hardware wallets. They should be used only to store small amounts of bitcoin, consider them as your everyday wallet in your pocket."
